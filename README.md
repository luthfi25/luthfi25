👋 Hi, I’m Luthfi, currently working as a Technical Support Associate. My day-to-day work mainly involves with responding to client's inquiries and educate clients how our systems behave.

👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering in a large scale systems. I also have side interest in Text Mining (had a research experience in Topic Model).

🌱 I’m currently learning Game Development as my hobby. I like to spend time in almost every weekend learning Game Development methodologies. (I use Unity3D!)

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Video Game for education purposes. Also anything that relate to my past experiences.
