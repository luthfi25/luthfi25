👋 Hi, I’m Luthfi (pronounced 'Loot-Vee'), currently working as a Support Engineer for GitHub. My day-to-day work mostly helping customers to resolve their accounts, general securities, or compliance-related problem.

👀 I’m interested in all-things-Software and how we can maximize the potential to simplify, if not resolve, people problems. 

🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analytics as my hobby. I like to spend time in almost every weekend learning new methods. (I use Kaggle!)

💞️ Outside of my work, I’m interested in and looking to collaborate on projects that relates to my prior experience including Software Development, Text Analytics project, and Game Development.
